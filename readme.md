# Patient Disease Drug Graph


#### [中文介绍传送门-Chinese Introduction Portal](readme-zh.md)

This is the display project of the drug database. The use of spring-boot made url redirect, the front end of the use of thymeleaf as MVC model to pass the data receiver.

## Introduction to data set

The data set is rdf data set, on the physical therapy, which has a diagnosis, medication, etc., web online display only shows a part of the data, download the `nt` format data, you can get a `complete data set`.

Using these data sets, you can perform sparql queries, perform entity relationship identification, perform medical data mining, and so on.

So what is `important` is this data set ，not this project！

## What is PDD Graph 

What is PDD Graph (Patient-Disease-Drug Graph):

Electronic medical records contain multi-format electronic medical data that consist of an abundance of medical knowledge. Facing with patients symptoms, experienced caregivers make right medical decisions based on their professional knowledge that accurately grasps relationships between symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments. We aim to capture these relationships by constructing a large and high-quality heterogeneous graph linking patients, diseases, and drugs (PDD) in EMRs.

Specifically, we extract important medical entities from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) and automatically link them with the existing biomedical knowledge graphs, including ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank. The PDD graph presented is accessible on the Web via the SPARQL endpoint, and provides a pathway for medical discovery and applications, such as effective treatment recommendations.

A subgraph of PDD is illustrated in the followng figure to betterunderstand the PDD graph.

# Update

*    ### V1.3

       We have attached DDI triples in the latest version 1.3. These DDI triples are extracted from DrugBank and will be applied to conveniently retrieve the possible adverse drug combinations taken by corresponding patients.

     A specific example please refer to the Tutorial [SPARQL Query Example5](http://kmap.xjtudlc.com/pdd/Tutorial.html#example5)


*   ### V1.2

    Fix the bugs in "diagnose_icd_information.nt".

    In the new version, we have eliminated an engineering bug that was made when label matching of ICD-9 codes. This bug results in the linking failures of 380 diseases in MIMIC-III.
  
     For diseases in the latest PDD version, the overall number of diseases is 6985, and 6,983 diseases are connected to ICD-9 ontology. The only two failed matching codes are '71970' and 'NULL', which are not included in ICD-9 ontology.

*   ### V1.1

    Add Patient BMI data.


## This Project Technology

not data set

- spring-boot
- thymeleaf
- jquery

## Example

When you want to query out an entity, click directly to see what the entity is. E.g:


In [Patient-Disease-Drug Data Set](http://kmap.xjtudlc.com/pdd/dataset.html?tab=query&ds=/pdd)，Can be online inquiries, you can see the data as follows:

When we click on one of the data,E.g:[http://kmap.xjtudlc.com/pdd_data/resource/145834](http://kmap.xjtudlc.com/pdd_data/resource/145834) , you can see what the current system shows:
